# Bitcoin Lending Protocol

A decentralized lending protocol built on the Stacks blockchain that enables users to collateralize Bitcoin to borrow Stacks tokens or stablecoins. The protocol features flexible repayment terms tied to Bitcoin's price movements.

## Overview

The Bitcoin Lending Protocol leverages Stacks' Bitcoin clarity to create a secure lending platform where users can:
- Deposit BTC as collateral
- Borrow STX or supported stablecoins
- Manage loans with dynamic interest rates
- Monitor collateralization ratios
- Participate in liquidations

### Key Features

- Bitcoin collateralization
- Dynamic interest rate model
- Automated liquidation system
- Price-adjusted repayment terms
- Real-time BTC/USD price feeds
- Secure multi-signature controls

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) (v1.0.0 or higher)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.0.0 or higher)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (latest stable version)
- Access to a Bitcoin node (for testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-lending-protocol.git
cd bitcoin-lending-protocol
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
clarinet requirements
npm install
```

3. Set up development environment:
```bash
clarinet integrate
```

### Development Setup

1. Start local Clarinet console:
```bash
clarinet console
```

2. Run tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

3. Check contract:
```bash
clarinet check
```

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Contracts

1. `lending-protocol.clar`
   - Main lending protocol logic
   - Collateral management
   - Loan operations
   - Interest calculations

2. `oracle-interface.clar`
   - Price feed integration
   - BTC/USD price updates
   - Data validation

### Key Functions

- `provide-collateral`: Lock BTC as collateral
- `take-loan`: Borrow against deposited collateral
- `repay-loan`: Make loan payments
- `liquidate`: Process liquidations
- `check-health`: Monitor loan health

## Testing

The protocol includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
clarinet test tests/lending-protocol_test.ts
```

### Test Categories

- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for contract interactions
- Property-based tests for edge cases
- Simulation tests for economic scenarios

## Security Considerations

- Multiple security audits required before mainnet
- Formal verification of critical functions
- Regular security assessments
- Bug bounty program (planned)

## Deployment

### Testnet Deployment

1. Configure environment:
```bash
clarinet requirements --testnet
```

2. Deploy contracts:
```bash
clarinet deploy --testnet
```

### Mainnet Deployment

Detailed mainnet deployment guidelines will be provided after security audits.
