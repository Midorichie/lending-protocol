;; Title: Bitcoin Lending Protocol
;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Description: A lending protocol enabling Bitcoin-collateralized loans on Stacks

;; Constants
(define-constant contract-owner tx-sender)
(define-constant err-owner-only (err u100))
(define-constant err-insufficient-collateral (err u101))
(define-constant err-invalid-amount (err u102))
(define-constant err-loan-exists (err u103))

;; Data Variables
(define-data-var minimum-collateral-ratio uint u150) ;; 150% collateralization ratio
(define-data-var liquidation-ratio uint u120) ;; 120% liquidation threshold

;; Data Maps
(define-map loans
    { borrower: principal }
    {
        collateral-amount: uint,        ;; Amount of BTC collateral in sats
        loan-amount: uint,              ;; Amount of STX borrowed
        loan-timestamp: uint,           ;; When the loan was taken
        last-price-check: uint,         ;; Last BTC price check timestamp
        interest-rate: uint,            ;; Annual interest rate (basis points)
        liquidation-price: uint         ;; BTC price that triggers liquidation
    }
)
